# About the author

I am retired from the U.S. Naval Reserves after serving 4 years on 
active duty, 10 years with the Michigan Air National Guard and 6 years 
with the Naval Reserves.  I have been a member of Tricare for about 
4 years now.

When I first joined I discovered that there was a lot that I did not 
know about Tricare or how to join/use their service.  Then the other 
day I met another person that was in the same boat, pun intended as 
we are both Navy retirees.  However Tricare is available for members 
from all branches of the US military and their families.

After meeting this person it gave me the idea to create this brochure 
for the information to provide the information to any other of you that 
are in the same situation.

All of the information contained here is taken directly from the 
Tricare website.  The individual pages are indicated by the footnotes 
at the bottom of the page.

## My experiences with Tricare.
I have discovered that there are 3 ways to submit your claims:

    1. By mail.  
    
    This takes a long time for the claim to arrive there.  
    You should make 2 copies of all receipts, 1 to send with your claim 
    and the other to keep for your records.
    
    2. By fax @ + 1 608-301-2251.
    
    3. By Tricare's on-line web site.  
    
    This allows you to send up to 3 documents at a time.  My scanner 
    software has an option to create a multi-page file in either PDF 
    or TIFF formats.  Tricare's security software turned the TIFF 
    file all BLACK, but the PDF file went through OK. By using the 
    multi-page function additional pages can be sent, including the 
    DD Form 2642 and copies of all receipts.
