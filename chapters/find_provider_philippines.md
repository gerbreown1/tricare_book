# Finding a Doctor or Pharmacy in the Philippines.

The below link will allow you to find a Doctor or Pharmacy in the 
Philippines.  It will ask you for a Province, City, Specialty, 
Provider Name and Status.  If Province is selected then it will show 
all listed for that province and then it can be narrowed down by City 
or Specialty.  After you make your selection just click on the “Search” 
button.  In the middle of the page you can download in “Excel” or “PDF” 
format the entire list of approved providers as a 26 page document or 
certified providers as a 311 page PDF document.  These lists are updated 
on a regular basis so you should be checked prior to using the services 
of any provider to make sure they are still registered.

Rose Pharmacy, Mercury Drug and some Watson Drug stores have been approved 
nation wide.

Philippines Pharmacy Changes: Effective September 1, 2011, reimbursement 
of pharmaceuticals in the Philippines will only be cost-shared when 
purchased at a TRICARE certified licensed retail pharmacy or TRICARE 
certified hospital-based pharmacy. Pharmaceuticals purchased from and/or 
billed by your healthcare provider’s office will no longer be 
cost-shared by TRICARE.
