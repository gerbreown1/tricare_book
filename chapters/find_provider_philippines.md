# Finding a Doctor or Pharmacy in the Philippines.

The following link will help you find a [Doctor or Pharmacy](http://tricare-overseas.com/ProviderSearch/Beneficiary_PhilippineDemonstration_ProvSearch.aspx) in the Philippines.  It will ask you for a 
Province, City, Specialty, 
Provider Name and Status.  If Province is selected then it will show 
all listed for that province and then it can be narrowed down by City 
or Specialty.  After you make your selection just click on the 
“Search” button.

You can also search for a provider by name.

In the middle of the page you can download in “Excel” or “PDF” format 
the entire list of approved providers as a 26 page document or 
certified providers as a 311 page PDF document that lists all the providers
in the Philippines.

These lists are updated on a regular basis so they should be checked 
prior to using the services of any provider to make sure they are still 
registered.

Rose Pharmacy, Mercury Drug and some Watson Drug stores in the Philippines 
have been approved nation wide.
