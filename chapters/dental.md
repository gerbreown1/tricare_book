# Dental plan.

Dental coverage is separate from TRICARE's medical coverage. Active 
duty service members are covered by active duty dental benefits 
including the Active Duty Dental Program. 

All others may enroll in the [TRICARE Dental Program](http://tricare.mil/Dental/TDP.aspx) 
or the [TRICARE Retiree Dental](http://tricare.mil/Dental/TRDP.aspx) Program.
