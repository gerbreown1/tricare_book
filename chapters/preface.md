# Preface

This book is being presented to provide you information about the
TRICARE FOR LIFE and the TRICARE STANDARD OVERSEAS plans, which are
just 2 of the many plans that are offered by [TRICARE](www.tricare.mil).
These plans are available to US military personnel on active duty,
activated Guard or Reserve or retired from those categories and their
families.

This book was originally published as a PDF brochure using LibreOffice
Writer program.  It is now being published using the Softcover application.

This information is being compiled from information that is posted on
the Tricare website.  Each chapter contains links to the pages on the Tricare
website that pertain to the information being presented in the chapter.

A lot of the information pertains to persons living in the US so I will
try to point out changes that apply to persons living outside of the US.
