## When you have Medicare Parts A and B, you're automatically covered by 
TRICARE For Life.

1. Available worldwide.
     1. TRICARE pays **after** Medicare in the U.S. and U.S. Territories.
     1. TRICARE is the first payer in all other overseas areas.
1. Meets requirements for minimum essential coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
1. Enrollment not required, but you must pay Medicare Part B premiums.

## Getting care
1. You may visit any authorized[^authorized] provider.  In the Philippines there is a 
list of [preferred providers](http://tricare-overseas.com/ProviderSearch/Beneficiary_PhilippineDemonstration_ProvSearch.aspx) 
that you need to check as Tricare will only reimburse the charges if the 
provider is on the list.
2. For services covered by TRICARE but not by Medicare, TRICARE
     For Life pays first and Medicare pays nothing. You must pay
     the TRICARE fiscal year deductible ($150.00) and cost shares
     (25%). _MEDICARE does NOT pay for anything outside of the US,
     so TRICARE is the prime provider._

## Out-of-Pocket Costs
  1. You don't pay any enrolment fees, but you must pay Medicare Part
  B monthly [premiums](http://tricare.mil/Costs/PayFees.aspx).
  2. Outside the US the beneficiary pays the provider and then submits
  a claim for reimbursement to TRICARE.

## TRICARE For Life Contractor

In the U.S. and U.S. Territories, Wisconsin Physicians Service
[WPS](https://www.tricare4u.com/apps-portal/tricareapps-app/static/index.htm) is the TRICARE For Life contractor. WPS-TRICARE For Life
will provide customer service and claims processing services.

## Is TRICARE For Life Right for You?

If you have both Medicare Part A and Part B, then TRICARE For Life
is the plan for you. Coverage is available worldwide and you can see
any provider you want. However, you will have greater out of pocket
expenses if you get care from Veteran's Administration providers or
providers who opt-out of Medicare, because they are not permitted to
bill Medicare _or are not in the US or its territories._

## TRICARE For Life Costs
1. When you use TRICARE For Life, you don't pay any enrollment fees.
But you must pay Medicare Part B monthly premiums. Your Part B premium
is based on your income. For more information about Part B premiums
visit www.medicare.gov or call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213
(TTY: 1-800-325-0778).

2. For services covered by TRICARE but not by Medicare:
   1. TRICARE For Life pays first.
   1. Medicare pays nothing.
   1. You must pay the TRICARE fiscal year deductible and cost shares.
   1. View the TRICARE For Life [cost chart](http://tricare.mil/~/media/Files/TRICARE/Publications/PubsNotOnPubsPage/TFL_cost_matrix_2014.pdf) for more information.
   1. Note: If you get care overseas (excluding U.S. Territories),
      you'll have the same costs as TRICARE Standard Overseas.
