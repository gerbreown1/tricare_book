# New Spouses

## When you marry an active duty or retired service member, you become entitled to military benefits, including TRICARE.

### Your sponsor must register you in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System [(DEERS)](http://tricare.mil/Welcome/Eligibility/DEERS.aspx).

### Once registered in DEERS, you'll get your own uniformed services identification card and you can start using TRICARE.
         
## Your Health Plan Options
  
### You may be eligible for the following health plans:
     
* TRICARE [Prime](http://tricare.mil/Welcome/Plans/Prime.aspx)
* TRICARE [Standard and Extra](http://tricare.mil/Welcome/Plans/TSE.aspx)
* [US Family Health Plan](http://tricare.mil/Welcome/Plans/USFHP.aspx)
* TRICARE [Standard Overseas](http://tricare.mil/Welcome/Plans/TSO.aspx)
* [TRICARE For Life](http://tricare.mil/Welcome/Plans/TFL.aspx)
     
## Your Benefits
  
### TRICARE covers most inpatient and outpatient care that is medically necessary. [>>See what's covered](http://tricare.mil/CoveredServices/SeeWhatsCovered.aspx)
   
### TRICARE provides a robust [pharmacy benefit](http://tricare.mil/Pharmacy.aspx).
   
### You can enroll in one of TRICARE's dental plans.
   
* TRICARE [Dental Program](http://tricare.mil/Dental/TDP.aspx) (if your sponsor is on active duty or in the Guard/Reserves)
       
* TRICARE [Retiree Dental Program](http://tricare.mil/Dental/TRDP.aspx) (if your sponsor is retired from active duty or Guard/Reserves)
    
## Out-of-Pocket Costs
 
Your health care costs are based on your sponsor's status 
     (active duty or retired) and which health plan option you are using.
     
## Coverage for Children
 
### Biological, adopted and step-children are covered by TRICARE.
    
* **Eligibility for children.**

    Unmarried biological and adopted children are eligible for TRICARE until 
    age 21 (or 23 if in college, see "College Students" below). 

    Eligibility may extend beyond these age limits if he or she is severely disabled. 

##  Register in DEERS  

### To register your child (newborn or adopted) in DEERS, you need the following documents: 

###    A certificate of birth or adoption:
    
        If born in the United States—an original or certified-copy of 
        the birth certificate or certificate of live birth signed by 
        the attending physician or other hospital representative.
        
        If born overseas—a consular report of birth (FS-240).
        
        If adopted—a record of adoption or a letter of placement of 
        the child into the home by a recognized placement/adoption 
        agency or the court before the final adoption.
        
###    An Application for Identification Card/DEERS Enrollment (DD Form 1172-2) 
    
        The form needs to be signed by the sponsor and verifying 
        official at an ID card office.
        
        If the sponsor can't sign the form in person at an ID card 
        office, the spouse or legal guardian needs either a notarized 
        copy of the form or a power of attorney.

## Apply for a Social Security Number.

    You don't need a Social Security number (SSN) when you first 
    register your child in DEERS, but you need to update DEERS with the 
    SSN when you have it. To apply for your child's SSN:
        
+        Apply [online](http://www.ssa.gov/)
+        Call 1-800-772-1213
    
## Child Scenarios

### Step-children
*    Step-children are eligible for TRICARE as long as the parent of the child and sponsor are married.  
* If the marriage ends in divorce, the step-children lose eligibility on the date the divorce decree is final.
*    If the sponsor adopts his or her step-children, they remain covered as adopted children even if the marriage ends in divorce.

### College students
    
    Eligibility can be extended up to age 23 if:

+ Your child is enrolled in a full course of study at an approved institution of higher learning.
+ You're still providng more than half of their financial support 

    You'll need a letter from the school's registrar's office stating that your child is enrolled full-time in an accredited college in pursuit of an Associate's Degree or higher.

    Eligibility ends on your child's 23rd birthday or when he or she is out of school, whichever comes first.
