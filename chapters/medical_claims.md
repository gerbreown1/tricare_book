# Medical Claims

Sometimes, you'll need to file your own claims (i.e. when traveling or 
getting care from a non-participating provider) or if you are living 
outside of the US or its territories.

If you do, send your claim form to TRICARE as soon as possible after 
you receive care. 

The sooner your claim and other paperwork are received, the sooner you 
or your provider will be paid.

1. In the U.S. and U.S. territories, claims must be filed within one 
year of service.
2. In all other overseas areas, claims must be filed within three 
years of service.
3. You'll be reimbursed for TRICARE-covered services at the TRICARE 
allowable amount. This amount won't include any copayments, cost 
shares or deductibles.
