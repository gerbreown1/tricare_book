# Medical Claims

Sometimes, you'll need to file your own claims (i.e. when traveling or 
getting care from a non-participating provider). If you do, send your 
claim form to TRICARE as soon as possible after you receive care. 
The sooner your claim and other paperwork are received, the sooner you 
or your provider will be paid.

1. In the U.S. and U.S. territories, claims must be filed within one 
year of service.
2. In all other overseas areas, claims must be filed within three 
years of service.
3. You'll be reimbursed for TRICARE-covered services at the TRICARE 
allowable amount. This amount won't include any copayments, cost 
shares or deductibles.

          contain my SSN.  Maybe in the US they would, but not here in 
          the Philippines.__
       b) Provider's name and address (if more than one provider's name 
          is on the bill, circle the name of the person who treated you)
